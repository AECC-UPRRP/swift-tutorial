## Basics of Swift ##
------

**This tutorial is not an Xcode project.** These are guide files to learn the basics of Swift and then start a small application.

It includes a [Playground](#playground) and two [ViewControllers](#viewcontrollers)

### Playground ###

By follow this file you will see some basics examples of the Swift syntax like: 

	* Explicits Variable and Constat Values
	* Closures
	* Extensions
	* Classes
	* Typealias

### ViewControllers ###

	* StudentsViewController
	* StudentEditViewController

We will use these controllers to start a simple app that consist of two table views. If all goes as planned, we will be able to add info, edit info and save info in the table.
